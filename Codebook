Initially, there were 561 variables and 10299 observations for the merged data. 
According to the assignement requirements, only variables containing means and standard deviations were chosen to create a new dataset.
The dataset was combined with the features.txt file to get the string names for variables
This resulted in 46 variables for means and 33 variables for standard deviation together making up a dataset of 79 variables and 10299 observations.
Furthermore, the dataset was merged with subject file to get an additional column indicating subjects that perormed the activities.
The labels dataset was joned with the activity_labels file to get text descriptions for each number-coded activity. 
The oucome of the 6 was merged with the bigger means and st. dev dataset to form activity labels. 
The outcome was a dataset with 81 variables and 10299 observations (a number-coded activity variable was removed as reundant).
The column names for the newly added columns named as V1 and V2 for "subject" and "activity" were renamed as "subject" and "activity" columns.
The latter data frame was converted into data table to perform data aggregation via lapply function.
Finally, all variables were aggregated by means for each combination of the subject and activity.
